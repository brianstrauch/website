            <h1>Real-Time Seam Carving</h1>
            <p>This is a demo of real-time seam carving, as described in section 5 of <a href="https://faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/SCWeb/imret/imret.pdf">Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing [Avidan and Shamir 2007]</a>. The background image of Big Sur, CA is capable of resizing to fit any window size by incrementally removing vertical low-energy seams from the original image. Furthermore, Bixby Creek Bridge has been specially marked so it will never change its size, regardless of the shape of the window.</p>
